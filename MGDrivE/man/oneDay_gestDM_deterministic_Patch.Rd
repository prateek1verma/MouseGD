\title{Deterministic Gestating Pup Death and Maturation}
\usage{
oneDay_gestDM_deterministic_Patch()
}
\description{
Daily gestating pup survival is calculated according to \deqn{\overline{E_{[t-1]}} * {1-\mu_{aq}}},
where \eqn{\mu_{aq}} corresponds to daily non-density-dependent juvenile mortality.
Gestating Pups transition into nursing pups at the end of \eqn{T_e}. \cr
See \code{\link{parameterizeMGDrivE}} for how these parameters are derived.
