\usage{
oneDay_adoDM_deterministic_Patch()
}
\description{
Daily adolescent survival is calculated according to \deqn{\overline{P_{[t-1]}} * {1-\mu_{JI}}},
where \eqn{\mu_{JI}} corresponds to adolescent mortality due to infection. \cr
See \code{\link{parameterizeMGDrivE}} for how these parameters are derived.
